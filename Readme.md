## About the medical notes generator

It is often difficult to find de-identified medical notes that can be used for product demonstration or for testing NLP algorithms. This library uses [GPT-2](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/gpt2.html) from the transformers package to generate medical text. It also randomly generates patient name, age and gender.
